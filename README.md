## Description :

The goal of the game is to clear the playing field by forming groups of two or more marbles of the same color. The game ends when the balls reach the bottom line of the screen. The more balls destroyed in one shot, the more points scored. A player wins when there are no balls remaining on the playing field.

## Features :

- There are 4 ball themes as shown in the video available for all levels .
- There is an animated background in the menu as shown in the video .
- If a group of balls are hit and there are balls suspended in the air, they fall at different speeds to give a wonderful appearance as shown in the video .
